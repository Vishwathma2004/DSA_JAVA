// There are numBottles water bottles that are initially full of water. You can exchange numExchange empty water bottles 
// -from the market with one full water bottle.

//The operation of drinking a full water bottle turns it into an empty bottle.

//Given the two integers numBottles and numExchange, return the maximum number of water bottles you can drink.
//Input: numBottles = 9, numExchange = 3
//Output: 13
//Explanation: You can exchange 3 empty bottles to get 1 full water bottle.
//Number of water bottles you can drink: 9 + 3 + 1 = 13
